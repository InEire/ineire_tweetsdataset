This dataset accompanies the paper titled **XAI Analysis of Online Activism to Capture Integration in Irish Society through Twitter** 

It has been anonymized for the purpose of distribution

Abstract:

Online activism over Twitter has assumed a multidimensional nature, especially in societies with abundant multicultural identities. In this paper, we pursue a case study of Irelandâ€™s Twitter landscape and specifically migrant and native activists on this platform. We aim to capture the level to which immigrants are integrated into Irish society and study the similarities and differences between their characteristic patterns by delving into the features that play a significant role in classifying a Twitterer as a migrant or a native. A study such as ours can provide a window into the level of integration and harmony in society.
